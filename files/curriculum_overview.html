      <p>
        Our classes focus on social development and learning through play.
        Each year’s class builds on the previous year’s program in curriculum
        experiences and activities offered. The classrooms are set up to
        invite exploration and foster a lifelong love of learning. Our staff
        is deeply committed to the young child and the importance of early
        childhood education.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that children are unique individuals with
        their own patterns and timetables for social, emotional, intellectual, and physical development.
        We support and encourage their development through our child-centered, process-oriented, playbased curriculum built on Constructivist theories and practices. Guided by the teachings of
        educational theorists including Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, DeVries, and others, we create a
        learning environment that addresses the developmental needs of the whole child by:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left:2vw;">
        <li>Structuring classroom experiences around ideas and topics that are relevant to the
          students, with the understanding that knowledge is constructed through language, discussion, experimentation, and manipulation of objects that are meaningful to them</li>
        <li>Offering hands-on learning experiences that use a variety of materials, engage multiple
          senses, and encourage exploration, investigation, and learning</li>
        <li>Allowing each child to interact with the environment at his/her own pace, and creating
          opportunities for children to explore individually, with a partner, or with a larger group
          of peers</li>
        <li>Asking open-ended questions, allowing students the time to thoughtfully form responses,
          listening respectfully to their replies, and gently guiding them toward the answers they
          seek as they develop enhanced reasoning skills</li>
        <li>Respecting students’ ideas, encouraging independent thinking, and empowering students
          to become problem solvers</li>
        <li>Using the wonderful resource of our diverse, multi-cultural population to highlight the
          similarities and differences between individuals, families, and cultures, celebrating the
          unique environment that is Washington University Nursery School.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Washington University Nursery School’s open curriculum framework is presented in ways that
        are developmentally appropriate and based on our philosophy that children learn most effectively
        through play. Using a learning center approach, each teaching team offers experiences in art,
        writing, science, dramatic play, blocks, manipulatives, and literacy. Teacher planning takes into
        account the social, emotional, intellectual, and physical developmental needs of each child. Further
        discussion about students' development in these fields can be conducted during 
        <a href="files/bear_tracks.html" rel="bookmark">parent-teacher conferences.</a>
      </p>
