      <h1>Curriculum Overview</h1>
      <p>
        Our classes focus on social development and learning through play.
        Each year’s class builds on the previous year’s program in curriculum
        experiences and activities offered. The classrooms are set up to
        invite exploration and foster a lifelong love of learning. Our staff
        is deeply committed to the young child and the importance of early
        childhood education.
      </p>
