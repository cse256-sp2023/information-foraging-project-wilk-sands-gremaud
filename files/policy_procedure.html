    <button class="accordion">Drop Off and Pick Up</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        All	traffic	for	arrival	and	dismissal	must	proceed	from	the	parking	lot	entrance	west	of	the	
school,	driving	east	and	stopping	at	the	school	entrance.	Drivers	stay	in	their	cars	and	
13
teachers	help	the	children	enter	and	exit.	Teachers	are	outside	for	arrival	of	children	at	8:50	
a.m.	for	the	morning	session	and	12:30 p.m.	for	the	afternoon	session.		At	no	time	should	
your	child	be	allowed	to	exit	your	car	without	a	teacher	present.		If	you	arrive	late,	you	must	
escort	your	child	to	the	classroom.		At	dismissal	(11:45	a.m.	and	3:15	p.m.)	children	assemble	
outside	the	front	door	on	benches	or,	in	inclement	weather,	inside	the	front	door.		The	
teachers	bring	children	to	their	cars.		No	child	can	be	dismissed	to	anyone	other	than	persons	
designated	(in	writing)	by the	parents.	Your	child	must	hold	hands	with	a	teacher	or	parent	
when	in	front	of	the	school	in	the	drop-off/pick-up	area.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Parking</button>
    <div class="panel">
      
      <p>
        Free parking is	available adjacent to the Nursery School.
        These three, 30-minute spots are typically available during	the	school day.	
        Parking	in	Zone 3 is only permitted with a	Yellow Zone	3 parking pass.
        Parents	and	visitors wishing to	have a longer visit	should park	in the 
        Millbrook or Snow Way parking garages,	located	off	Throop	Drive	and	Snow	Way.		Visitor	
parking	in	these	lots	is	$2.00	for	the	first	two hours.		The	Nursery	School	will	provide	
validation	tickets	to	parents	that	park	in	the	garage	for	special	school	events.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Clothing</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        It	is	recommended	that	children	be	dressed	in	play	clothes	that	are	comfortable,	washable,	
and	suitable	for	activities	both	indoors	and	outdoors.		Children	need	to	have	at	least	one	
extra	set	of	clothing	appropriate	to	the	season	that	can	be	kept	at	school.	Parents	should	be	
aware	of	weather conditions	and	dress	children	accordingly,	as	outdoor	play	is	an	integral	
part	of	the	daily	schedule.		During	the	winter	months	our	general	guideline	for	outdoor	play	
is	that	we	will	usually	go	outside	when	it	is	above	20	degrees,	with	wind	chill	taken	into	
account.		Please	mark	your	child’s	name	in	permanent	marker	on	all	clothing	so	that	it	can	be	
easily	identified.				
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Snacks</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        The	nursery	school	provides	a	healthy	snack	each	day	for	the	children.	Fresh	fruit	(apples,	
oranges,	pears,	bananas,	melons,	etc.)	are	purchased	each	week	and	kept	in	the	“children’s	
refrigerator.”	There	are	a	wide	variety	of	crackers	(soda,	graham,	Ritz,	Goldfish,	etc.)	
available.	Snack	time	consists	of	a	fruit,	crackers	and	water.	The	older	children	learn	to	pour	
their	own	water.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Birthdays</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        We	celebrate	each	child’s	birthday	(or	half-birthday	for	children	with	summer	dates).		If	
desired,	talk	with	your	child’s	teacher	about	bringing	a	special	snack	to	share	with	the	class.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Holidays</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        We	are	fortunate	to	have	diverse	cultures	and	religious	beliefs	in	our	nursery	school	
community.		Our	policy	is	to	celebrate	family	traditions,	not	the	religious	aspects,	of	holidays
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Field Trips</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Teachers	frequently	plan	short	walking	trips	on	campus.		Occasionally,	trips	are	planned	offcampus	to	further	enhance	the	children’s	experiences.		Each	time	an	off-campus	trip	is	
11
planned,	parents	will	be	notified	in	advance	and	required	to	sign	a	form	granting	permission	
for	the	child’s	participation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Medication</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        The	nursery	school	encourages	parents	to administer	medications	at	home	and	not at	school.		
The	nursery	school	staff	does	not	routinely	administer	medications	to	the	children.		Also,	we	
do	not	apply sunscreen	or	insect	repellent.		Medication	that	absolutely	needs	to	be	
administered	during	school	hours	must	be	cleared	with	the	director.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Allergies</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        If	your	child	has	a	known	allergic	reaction,	this	must	be	documented	on	the	child’s	History	
and	Health	Record	kept	in	his/	her	file	in	the	office.		Also,	please	report	these	allergies	to	the
classroom	teachers.		For	your	child’s	safety,	these	allergies	will be	posted	in	your	child’s	
classroom.		If	you	object	to	this	information	being	posted,	please	contact	the	director.		In	case	
of	severe	allergies	such	as	to	bee	stings or	nuts,	an	EpiPen	Injector	Kit	may	be	kept	at	the	
nursery	school	and	used	by	the	director	and/or	teachers	who	are	trained	in	its	
administration.		This	is	stored	in	the	emergency	backpack in	the	child’s	classroom.		Each	
classroom	has	a	First	Aid	Kit	that	includes	the	EpiPen	(if	required).		This,	along	with	
emergency	medical	forms	for	every	child,	accompanies	the	classes	on	all	walking	or	driving	
field	trips.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Peanut and Tree Nut Policy</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        A	growing	number	of	children	deal	with	food	allergies	and,	specifically, potentially	lifethreatening	peanut	and	tree	nut	allergies.	 Washington	University	Nursery	School	will	be	a	
peanut- and	tree	nut-free (Brazil	nuts,	almonds,	cashews,	pistachios,	walnuts,	pecans,	and	
hazelnuts) preschool	beginning	with	the	2017-2018	school	year.	 The	full	explanation	of	
the Peanut	and	Tree	Nut	Policy describes	how	teachers	and	families	will	support	the	efforts	
of	safeguarding	the	health	and	safety	of	the	children.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Accidents</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        The	nursery	school	makes	every	effort	to	ensure	the	safety	of	all	children.		However,	should	a	
serious	accident	occur,	a	parent	is	immediately	contacted.		If	parents	and	emergency	contacts	
cannot	be	reached,	we	will	take	your	child	to	the	hospital	designated	on	your	enrollment	
form.		Minor	injuries	will	be	reported	to	you	by	your	child’s	teacher	at	pick-up.	All	injuries	
will	also	be	reported	in	written	form	and	given	to	you	at	pickup	time.	We	will	ask	you	to	sign	
an	identical	form	to	be	placed in	your	child’s	file	at	school.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Health Policy</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        The	nursery	school	makes	a	great	effort	to	provide	a	healthy	environment	for	your	children.		
We	work	diligently	on	forming	healthy	habits	such	as	washing	hands	before	eating	or	
handling	food,	and	after	toileting.		Our	dishes	and	cups	are	put	through	a	dishwasher/	
sanitizer	to	sterilize	them	and	to	prevent	the	spread	of	germs.		The	rooms	are	thoroughly	
12
cleaned	daily	and	checked	for	safety.		However,	despite	everyone’s	best	efforts,	children	and	
adults	will	get	sick.		It	is	an	expected	part	of	life.		If	children	become	ill	at	school,	they	will	be	
cared	for	in	the	office	until	a	parent	can	pick	them	up.		
Parents	are	requested	to	keep	their	child	home	in	the	event	of	the	diseases	or	symptoms	
noted	below.		The	child	will	be	allowed	to	return	to	school	when	he	or	she	has	been	free	of	
these	symptoms	and	has	not	required	medication	for	a	minimum	of	24	hours.		If	a	symptom	
persists	(such	as	rash	or	cough),	or	if	a	communicable	disease	is	confirmed	(measles,	chicken	
pox,	etc.),	returning	to	school	may	require	a	statement	from	the	child’s	physician	declaring	
that	the	condition	is	no	longer	contagious.		
PLEASE	CALL	the	nursery	school	to	inform	us	that	your	child	is	sick,	especially	if	he/	she	has	
a	communicable	disease.		Communicable diseases	or	conditions	include:
strep	throat chicken	pox measles
mumps impetigo conjunctivitis
hepatitis	A diarrheal	diseases		 lice
scabies pinworm ringworm
certain	other	viral	or	bacterial	infections
Also,	the	following	symptoms	could	indicate a	contagious	disease:
fever lethargy
diarrhea sore	throat
vomiting reddened,	weeping	eyes
skin	eruptions	/	rashconstant	sneezing	/	productive	cough
runny	nose
If	your	child	is	exposed	to	or	contracts	a	communicable	disease,	it	is	essential	that	you call	
the	nursery	school	to	tell	us.		In	turn,	we	will	send	a	letter	home	to	inform	parents	that	your	
child	has	been	exposed	to	a	communicable	disease.

    <button class="accordion">Inclement Weather</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        The	nursery	school,	as	a	department	within Washington	University,	follows	the	university	
policy	for	school	closings	as	a	result	of	inclement	weather.	It	is university policy	that	faculty	
and	staff	members	should	report	to	work	and	leave	work	at	their	regularly	scheduled	times.	
Should	weather	conditions	create	potentially	hazardous	travel,	the	vice	chancellor	for	human	
resources	will	evaluate	the	severity	of	the	situation	and,	in	consultation	with	the	executive	
vice	chancellors,	determine	the	appropriate	measures	to	be	taken.	Factors	to	be	considered	
will	include	the	safety	of	our	faculty,	staff	and	students	as	well	as	the services	that	must	be	
provided	despite	the	severe	weather.	 In	the	event	that	the	decision	is	made	to	dismiss	
employees	early,	the	staff	of	the	Office	of	Human	Resources	will	contact	the	various	executive	
vice	chancellors,	vice	chancellors	and	deans,	who, in	turn,	will	be	responsible	for	
communicating	this	decision	to	faculty	and	staff	members. A	nursery	school	staff	member	
would	then	relay	that	decision	to	the	parent	community	via	phone	and/or	email.

    <button class="accordion">Children with Special Needs</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        It	is	the	policy	at	the	nursery	school	that	after	school	is	underway	and	teachers	have	had	time	
to	observe	children	in	the	classroom,	a	teacher	who	feels	help	is	needed	in	understanding	the	
behavior	of	a	child	in	the	classroom	will	ask	the	director	to	come and	observe.	After	
reviewing	our	observations,	we	schedule	an	appointment	with	the	parents	to	discuss	the	
school	behavior.	In	the	course	of	that	meeting,	we	may	request	that	a	community	
professional	evaluate	the	child	in	the	classroom.	This	observation	may	result	in	a	request	for	
further	evaluation.	If	needed,	community	facilities	that	better	serve	the	child’s	needs	may	be	
recommended	to	the	parents.	
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Confidentiality Statement</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        The	records	kept	on	families	enrolled	at	the	nursery	school	are	confidential.	Staff	may	not	
        share	information	on	file	with	others	without	written	permission	from	a	parent	or	guardian.	
        Information	received	while	in	the	performance	of	duties,	either	written	or	verbal,	shall	also	
        be	considered	confidential	and	shall	be	treated	the	same	as	written	information	contained	in	
        the	child’s	file.
        The	nursery	school	adheres	to	the	Code	of	Ethics	created	by	the	National	Association	for	the	
        Education	of	Young	Children	(NAEYC).	This	document	provides	guidelines	for	responsible	
        behavior	and	establishes	a	common	ground	for	early	childhood	professionals	to	resolve	
        15
        ethical	and	moral	issues	encountered	in	daily	practice.	The	foundation	for	the	Code	of	Ethics	
        is	a	commitment	to	quality	early	childhood	practices,	including	providers’	goals	to:
        • Appreciate	childhood	as	a	unique,	valuable	part	of	the	human	life.
        • Base	program	practices	on	knowledge	of	child	development.
        • Appreciate	and	support	the	child/family	bond.
        • Understand	children	in	the	context	of	their	family,	culture	and	society.
        • Respect	the	uniqueness	and worth	of	children,	family	members	and	colleagues.
        • Develop	helpful	relationships	based	on	trust,	respect	and	positive	regard.
