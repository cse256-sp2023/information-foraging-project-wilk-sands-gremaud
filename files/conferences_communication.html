      <h3>Parent-Staff Communication</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The	teachers,	staff,	and	administration	
        of	WUNS	share	our	parents’	commitment	to	their	children	and	join	them	in	partnership	
        dedicated	to	the	growth	of	each	child.	This	partnership	begins	with	timely,	honest	and	open	
        communication	between	home	and	school,	and	is	premised	on	an	assumption	of	goodwill	
        and a	shared	interest	in	what	is	best	for	each	individual	child.	Parents	can	best	support	this	
        climate	of	trust	and	respect	by	communicating	concerns	openly	and	constructively	to	the	
        teacher.	If	a	satisfactory	conclusion	is	not	reached,	the	parent	should	then contact	the	
        Director.
      </p>
      <p>
        Communication	is	ongoing	throughout	the	year.		Newsletters,	the	school	website	and	emails	
        give	you	information	on	current	themes,	activities	and	upcoming	events.		Phone	calls	and/or	
        emails	by	classroom	teachers	to	discuss	your	child’s	adjustment,	observations	and/or	
        concerns	are	common.		If	you	feel	you	need	to	speak	to	a	teacher	or	the	director,	please	email	
        or	call	the	office.		Teachers	can	be	reached	by	phone	or	email	after	the	school	day	is	over.	
      </p>

      <h3>Assessment	and	Parent-Teacher	Conferences</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Assessment	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	
        conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	teachers
         keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	
        development.	Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	children’s	
        writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities	
        in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.	
      </p>
      <p>
        Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring).	Teachers take note of
        students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and
        group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is
        informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child,
        and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The
        Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the
        curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
        child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to
        read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.	A	parent-teacher	conference	can	be	scheduled	at	any	
        time	during	the	year	as	needed	and	by	request	of	parents	and/or	teachers.
