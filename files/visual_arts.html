        At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many opportunities to express
        themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as
        important building blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is on the
        process of exploring materials and how they can be manipulated, rather than the product of those
        manipulations. We allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a
        successful and complete experience. These art experiences, whether undertaken independently
        or as part of a group, can help increase a childâ€™s attention span, improve fine motor skills,
        strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence. Materials and
        experiences include:
        <ul style="margin-left:2vw;">
          <li>Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk</li>
          <li>Painting with fingers, brushes, feathers, sponges, leaves, vegetables, and other materials
            and items</li>
          <li>Printmaking with rubber stamps, potato shapes, and various other objects</li>
          <li>Working with clay and doughs used for shaping, building, and modeling</li>
          <li>Cutting, tearing, gluing, and stapling</li>
          <li>Shaping/forming and stringing beads</li>
          <li>Creating collages from any combination of fabrics, paper, pictures, and a variety of threedimensional items</li>
          <li>Building 3-dimensional constructions using boxes, paper tubes, cartons, and other
            recyclable materials</li>
          <li>Creating pictures or structures using wire, clay, wood and other materials</li>
        </ul>
        Students at Washington University Nursery School enjoy exploring visual arts, music and drama
with specialists in these areas, in addition to the artistic opportunities that abound as part of their
everyday curriculum in the classroom and on the playground.
