      <p>
        At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many opportunities to express
        themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as
        important building blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is on the
        process of exploring materials and how they can be manipulated, rather than the product of those
        manipulations. We allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a
        successful and complete experience. These art experiences, whether undertaken independently
        or as part of a group, can help increase a child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills,
        strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence. Materials and
        experiences include:
        <ul style="margin-left:2vw;">
          <li>Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk</li>
          <li>Painting with fingers, brushes, feathers, sponges, leaves, vegetables, and other materials
            and items</li>
          <li>Printmaking with rubber stamps, potato shapes, and various other objects</li>
          <li>Working with clay and doughs used for shaping, building, and modeling</li>
          <li>Cutting, tearing, gluing, and stapling</li>
          <li>Shaping/forming and stringing beads</li>
          <li>Creating collages from any combination of fabrics, paper, pictures, and a variety of threedimensional items</li>
          <li>Building 3-dimensional constructions using boxes, paper tubes, cartons, and other
            recyclable materials</li>
          <li>Creating pictures or structures using wire, clay, wood and other materials</li>
        </ul>
        Students at Washington University Nursery School enjoy exploring visual arts, music and drama
with specialists in these areas, in addition to the artistic opportunities that abound as part of their
everyday curriculum in the classroom and on the playground.

        Each of the classes will have the opportunity to engage in Art
        Enrichment one time per month. We will introduce an Element of Art
        each month and build understanding through conversations and
        experiences in the Art Studio, that may be displayed and later sent
        home with a description of your child’s introduction to that Element
        of Art.

        I have had the privilege and honor of teaching Art Enrichment at WUNS
        since 2002. It is a great joy to share my knowledge and passion for
        the Visual Arts with the children! Each and every year I am reminded
        and continually astounded at the beauty, simplicity and sincerity of
        each young Artist’s understandings and renderings of Art from their
        personal perspective. Thank you for sharing your Preschooler with me!
